This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify chest X-ray images for COVID-19 detection. 
It includes data preprocessing, visualization, model definition, and evaluation using k-fold cross-validation.

The project trains a CNN to classify chest X-ray images into categories such as COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Healthy. 
It involves robust preprocessing techniques and evaluates the model's performance using k-fold cross-validation. 
The architecture is fine-tuned using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with momentum for better convergence
